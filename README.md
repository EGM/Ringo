# Ringo
Project Ringo is help data for DroidScript.

## Say What??

That breaks down into:

DroidScript is an Android app that allows you to make your own Android apps, utilizing JavaScript instead of Java.

Users have volunteered their time to help patch the holes in the DroidScript documentation.

This project is different because its data only, in the form of JSON, without any presentation markup.

That means _YOU_ can present it in any way you want.

Want to create a DroidScript function lookup for your IDE? No problem. Want to create help HTML help files using templates? Also no problem.

## Want to help?

Like I alluded to, this is a project by volunteer DroidScript users, and not officially connected to the makers of DroidScript.

Please feel free to clone this repo, add your knowledge, and make a pull request to merge the changes in so everyone using it can benefit. (Other examples of tools such as presenters and transformers would also be welcome.)

## Where to next?

* Design data model.
* Create default language (English) data skeleton framework.
* Create example editor.
* Create example presenter(s).
